# Retail Sales Analysis Using Python and Tableau

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of retail sales data to uncover actionable business insights. Using Python for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization, the project covers key aspects of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interactive dashboard creation. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle and contains customer demographics, purchase amounts, and transaction details.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
  - Handled missing values and formatted the dataset.  
  - Created new features, such as Age Groups and Day of the Week.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - **Time-Series Analysis**: Monthly and weekly trends in sales.  
  - **Category Insights**: Top-performing product categories and sales distribution.  
  - **Demographic Analysis**: Sales by gender, age group, and customer behavior patterns.  
  - **Day of the Week Analysis**: Trends in sales on weekdays vs. weekends.  

- **Interactive Dashboard in Tableau**:  
  - Built a dashboard with filters and interactive elements.  
  - Visualizations include:
    - Time-series trends.
    - Sales by product category and gender.
    - Distribution by age groups and day of the week.  
  - Users can dynamically explore sales data across different dimensions.

- **Insights and Recommendations**:  
  - Weekend sales are higher than weekdays.  
  - Female customers contribute slightly more to total sales than males.  
  - Customers aged 50-60 and 20-30 are key contributors to revenue.
